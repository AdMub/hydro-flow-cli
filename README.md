## 🚀 Overview

**Hydro-Flow CLI** is an AI-augmented command-line tool designed to bring **HEC-RAS caliber hydrology** to the terminal.

Hydrologic modeling usually requires expensive, heavy GUI software. **Hydro-Flow** breaks this barrier by providing a "Headless" engineering engine that helps engineers **design** channels, **visualize** flood risks, and **stress-test** infrastructure using statistical simulations—all from a simple CLI.

Battle-tested on the **Ona River Basin** (Nigeria), it empowers engineers to perform complex geospatial and hydraulic analysis using **Scipy**, **NumPy**, and **Docker**.

## ✨ Key Features & Engineering Logic

### 1. 🤖 Auto-Design (The Inverse Solver)
**The Problem:** Usually, engineers guess channel dimensions until they find one that works (Trial & Error).
**The Solution:** Hydro-Flow solves the **Inverse Hydraulic Problem** using **Scipy Optimization** (Newton-Raphson Method). It calculates the *exact* minimum channel width required to handle a target flood while minimizing excavation costs.

```bash
hydro design --target-q 500 --max-depth 5.0

# Output:
# ✅ OPTIMAL DESIGN FOUND
# Recommended Width: 8.79 m
# Excavation Volume: 118.97 m²/unit
```

## 🎲 Monte Carlo Stress Testing (Stochastic Analysis)
**The Problem:** Standard calculators assume perfect conditions. They fail to account for real-world variability.
**The Solution:** Hydro-Flow runs **1,000 parallel simulations** with randomized variables (Roughness $n \pm 10\%$, Flash Flood Surge $y \pm 20\%$) to generate a **Probability Density Function** of failure.



```bash
hydro stress-test --depth 3.8 --iterations 1000
# Output:
# 📊 Failure Probability: 24.5%
# 🖼️ Risk Graph Saved: local_workspace/risk_distribution.png
```

### 🎨 Visual Digital Twin
**The Solution:** Instantly generates professional hydraulic cross-sections (`.png`) showing water levels against channel banks using procedural **Matplotlib** plotting.


```bash
hydro visualize --depth 4.5
# Output: Image Saved: local_workspace/cross_section.png
```

### 🌉 Bridge Scour Analysis
**The Solution:** Calculates the **Backwater Effect** (Afflux) caused by bridge constrictions using **Bernoulli's Energy Principle,** predicting upstream flooding caused by infrastructure.

---

```bash
hydro bridge-check --contraction 0.7
# Rise in Water Level: +1.11 m
```

### 🤖 The AI Co-Engineer Experience
Built for the **GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge,** this project pushes the boundaries of what's possible in a BASH environment. I used Copilot as a **Domain Expert** and **DevOps Engineer:**

1. **Solving Inverse Problems:** I asked Copilot to help me map engineering constraints (Max Depth) into a Python cost function that `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` could understand.
    
2. **Containerization Hurdles:** When Dockerizing the application, I hit a critical `ModuleNotFoundError` due to Python path resolution. Copilot CLI helped me debug the `PYTHONPATH` environment variables and structure the `__init__.py` files to make the tool truly portable.

3. **Visual Engineering:** Copilot generated the complex coordinate geometry logic required to plot the trapezoidal banks and water surface fills in Matplotlib.

### 🛠️ Installation 
#### **Option A: Docker (Recommended for Production)**
Hydro-Flow is fully containerized. You don't need to install heavy libraries manually.
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t hydro-flow .

# Run the Auto-Designer inside Docker
docker run --rm hydro-flow design --target-q 300 --max-depth 4.0
```
#### **Option B: Local Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/AdMub/hydro-flow-cli.git](https://github.com/AdMub/hydro-flow-cli.git)
cd hydro-flow-cli

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```
